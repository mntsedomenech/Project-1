                <p>Wow, you have made it! Congratulations! After a long, long flight you have arrived in Japan. I am
                    sure you
                    can't wait to start exploring. For me, what I like to do most when I arrive in Tokyo is to hit the
                    streets
                    of Shinjuku. It has the best nightlife in Tokyo, countless restaurants to choose from, arcades,
                    shops and
                    much more. Shinjuku is also known for it's Karaoke Restaurants. After a few drinks you may feel bold
                    enough
                    to give it a try!</p>

                <h2>7 DAYS TRIP IN ICELAND</h2>
                <h5>The perfect roadtrip plan</h5>
                <img src="assets/images/IMG_1904.jpg" alt="blog">
                <p>So here I am going to share the best tips for an unforgettable trip to Iceland. The first thing to
                    take
                    into account is when are you visiting Iceland, as the kind of trip and things to see will vary. I am
                    going
                    to advise regarding Iceland during the winter season, this is from December to March. During the
                    dark winter months it is the best time to spot the Northern Lights which is one of the wonders of
                    Iceland. It is said that the best time to see them is March as is the warmest month where you could
                    see them.</p>
