            <h1>Welcome!</h1>
            <p>Hi, welcome to my personal travel blog. This is a place for community, experiences, excitent and sharing
                travel tips. My story is quite simple, I started travelling on my holidays as many of you, but soon came
                to
                realise that this was not enough. I made de desicion to quit my job and start a new career as a travel
                blogger.
                Starting was not easy, but with determination I created a new career and lifestyle that fulfills me. If
                you are
                please feel free to tag along on my joruney.

                <hr>
                <p>I was born in Barcelona, but I moved to Dublin in 2018. In Dublin is where I discover my love for
                    travelling and I started building up my new career path.

                <hr>
                <p>For the past two years, I have been travelling for a living and sharing my experiences with whoever wants
                    to listen. It has been an amazing oportunity meeting so many people from different places, and for that I am

                <p>Solo Female Travel has been the cornestone of my project. Since I started blogging main focus was to create a safe space for
                    women to share experiences, tips, and overall create friendships.

                <h2>Why solo female travel?</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>As women, we need to be extra careful with everything we do, especially when travelling. When I went on my first 
                    trip I remember being very scared, but why should we? Exactly, we should not. This is how my idea came about. Since
                    then I have been building this community so we can help each other while enjoy this wonderful world.
