            <p>Hi, welcome to my personal travel blog. This is a place for community, experiences, excitent and sharing
                travel tips. My story is quite simple, I started travelling on my holidays as many of you, but soon came
                to
                realise that this was not enough. I made de desicion to quit my job and start a new career as a travel
                blogger.
                Starting was not easy, but with determination I created a new career and lifestyle that fulfills me. If
                you are
                please feel free to tag along on my joruney.
            </p>
